## Reading & Start Activity

In class we'll be working through part of the Macrosystems EDDIE module on Understanding Uncertainty in Ecological Forecasts.
To prepare for this you should go to https://macrosystemseddie.shinyapps.io/module6/ and:

1. Read the `Overview` tab
2. Read through all of the slides on the `Presentation` tab
3. Read the `Introduction` tab
4. Complete `Activity A` (all 4 objectives), which will walk you through the basic data and models we'll be using and have you generate some deterministic forecasts
5. Save your progress by clicking the `Bookmark my progress` button at the top of the page, copying the url, and including it with your "Confusion"

In class we will then work through and discuss Activity B, which covers different types of uncertainty.
