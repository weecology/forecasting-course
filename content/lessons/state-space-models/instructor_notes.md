* What defines a state space model?
* What is the difference between process and observation error?
* What are the advantages of modeling them separately?
* What is the benefit of making predictions of the underlying state even if we can't observe it?
* What are some of the complexities that can be incorporated into state space models?
* How is the normal dynamic linear model constructed?
* How is nonlinearity integrated?
* Why is fitting state space models challenging?
* How might these models be useful for modeling time-series and making forecasts in ecology
