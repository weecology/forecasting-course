Watch the first 15 minutes of the Video and read the selected sections of the paper.

## Video

Watch **the first 15 minutes** of the this video by the lead author of the paper. It provides a nice overview of state space models.
Optionally you can watch the next 5 minutes, which provides some discussion of how to evaluate if state space models are performing well.
You are not expected to watch the last hour, which is a tutorial for fitting state-space models using a different software package than we will use followed by Q&A.
