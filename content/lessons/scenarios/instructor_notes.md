> What is an ecological surprise and how would it effect forecasting?

* A change in an ecological system unanticipated by current knowledge/models
* Difficult to incorporate into forecasts since not present in models
* Can have large impacts on future states of ecological systems
* Forecasts - most likely outcome
* Scenarios - explore range of possible outcomes

> What is scenario planning and how does it differ from predictions and forecasting?

* Thinking about range of possible futures
* Based on both existing knowledge
* But recognizing uncertainty and potential for surprises
* Constructing story lines for each possible future to guide decision making

> Has any one been involed in scenario planning?

> Which are the benefits of scenario planning?

* Identify strategies for different possible futures
* Be prepared to respond to different possible futures and respond if unexpected scenarios occur
* Actively engage stake-holders in planning and decision making processes in ways that create awareness of future changes
* Good for systematic planning in uncertain situations
* Allows consideration of different decisions leading to different outcomes
* Actively recognizes uncertainty/surprises

> What are some challenges you can envision for scenario planning?


> Are scenarios qualititive, quantitative, both?

* Can be qualitative, semi-quantitative, full quantative

> What are the reasons that environmental scenario planning needs ecology?

* Climate scenarios can fail to capture the complexity of ecological systems and their feedbacks on climate

> How will incorporating scenarios benefit ecologists and managers?
