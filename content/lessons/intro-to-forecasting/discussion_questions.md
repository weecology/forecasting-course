## Why ecological forecasting?

* Why do we need ecological forecasting?
* What are some of the things we need to be able to make forecasts?

## Forecastability?

* What influences our ability to forecast and how?

## Forecasting, planning, and goals

* What kinds of time-scales of forecasts do we want/need in ecology?
* How might these different "forecasting horizons" influence our approaches to forecasting?

## Determining what to forecast

* How should we think about what to forecast in ecology?

## Terminology

* What is the distinction between forecasting, prediction, projection & prognosis?
* Are these terms consistently used the two readings? In your experience more broadly?

## Uncertainty

* What is the distinction between point estimates and uncertainty?
* Do most ecological forecasts include uncertainty estimates?
* Why does estimating uncertainty matter?

## Forecasting data and methods

* What are the general types of models that can be used for forecasting and how do they differ?
* What are the different ways in which model parameters are determined?
* When might these different approaches be most appropriate in ecology?
* What are the different ways in which time and can incorporated into models?

## Basic steps

* How do the "basic steps" of forecasting relate to ecological forecasting?
