## Why ecological forecasting?

> Why do we need ecological forecasting?

* Manage environmental change
* Test how well we understand ecosystems

> What are some of things we need to be able to make forecasts?

* Models
* Data

## Forecastability?

> What influences our ability to forecast and how?

* How well the factors driving the response are understood
* How much data is available
* Whether the forecast influences the thing being forecast
    * Are there examples in ecology where a forecast could influence the thing being forecast?

## Forecasting, planning, and goals

> What kinds of time-scales of forecasts do we want/need in ecology?

> How might these different "forecasting horizons" influence our approaches to forecasting?

## Determining what to forecast

> How should we think about what to forecast in ecology?

* Talk to those who need or are impacted by the forecast
* Consider whether we have the data/models we need

## Terminology

> What is forecasting?

* Forecasting - probabalistic statement about the future using data assimilation.

> The Luo et al. paper distinguishes between forecasting, prediction, projection & prognosis. What are the core differences?

* Prediction - quantitative estimate of an unknown state. Can be about the future. Not necessarily accurate.
* Projection - Possible future state resulting from a choice of future scenarios. Typically quantitative.
* Prognosis - more subjective.
* **Note that these definitions vary across and even within disciplines**
* **Definition of forecasting is much more narrow than most**

> Are these terms consistently used the two readings? In your experience more broadly?

* Not really. Different fields, disciplines, and authors use them in different ways.

## Uncertainty

> What is the distinction between point estimates and uncertainty?

* Point estimates are the expected value or mean prediction
* Uncertainty is the variability around that mean value, that describes the reasonable range of predictions.

> Do most ecological forecasts include uncertainty estimates?

* No

> Why does estimating uncertainty matter?

* Need to know how much to trust forecasts
* What the realistic range of outcomes could be


## Forecasting data and methods

> What are the general types of models that can be used for forecasting and how do they differ?

* Data-driven vs. Process modeling
  * What is a good example of cross-sectional forecasting in ecology?
  * What is a good example of time-series forecasting?
* Within data-driven "Time series" vs. "Explanatory"

> What are the different ways in which model parameters are determined?

* Fixed
* Fitted
* How does this relate to process vs data-driven modeling?

> When might these different approaches be most appropriate in ecology?

> What are the different ways in which time can be incorporated into these models?

* Explicitly
* Implicitly (driving variables that change)
* Not included

## Basic steps

> How do the "basic steps" of forecasting relate to ecological forecasting?

* How well do you think our field does at each of these steps?
* What can we do to improve on our current approaches?

## Where do you think we are?

* How good do you think we currently are at forecasting in ecology?
* What does the history of weather forecasting tell you about how that might change?
