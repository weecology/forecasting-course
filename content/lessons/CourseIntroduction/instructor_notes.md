## Introductions

* Instructors
* Goals for the class
    * Forecasting is increasingly important
	  * Difficult
	  * Ecology hasn't historically done this well
	  * Need to study dynamics in order to understand this
  	* Need to learn how to work with dynamic (time-series) data
* Students
    * Introduce yourself
    * Tell us what do you hope to get out of the class

## How the course will run

* Mix of paper discussions, R tutorials, and working on a forecasting project
* Discussion
    * Read paper in advance
    * Questions to think about provided to help guide thinking while reading
    * Submit "confusions", anything that you were confused about when reading the paper before class
* R tutorials
    * Introductions to methods for working with dynamic data and forecasting
    * Focus on time-series data, models, and forecasts
	* I do, we do, you do
	* We will demonstrate a concept, have you follow along on your computers,
      and then have you do something very similar in class
* 2 credit course so other than reading and installing packages for R tutorials most work will be in class
* Grades
  * Paper discussions (22%)
    * Submit "confusions" before class
	  * Participating in paper discussions in class
	  * If you miss class you can submit written answers to the discussion questions
  * R tutorials (44%)
    * Submit completed R Tutorials via Canvas
    * If you attend class you should be done (or almost done) with them by the end of the period
    * If you can't make class follow along with R tutorial notes
        * Will include some sections for you to complete on your own
