### Why ecological forecasting?

> Why do we need ecological forecasting?

* Manage environmental change
* Test how well we understand ecosystems

> What are two some of things we need to be able to make forecasts?

* Models
* Data

### Terminology

> What is forecasting?

* Forecasting - probabalistic statement about the future using data assimilation

> What is the distinction between forecasting, prediction, projection &
  prognosis?

* Prediction - quantitative estimate of an unknown state. Can be [about the future. Not necessarily accurate.
* Projection - Possible future state resulting from a choice of future scenarios. Typically quantitative.
* Prognosis - more subjective.
* **Note that these definitions vary across and even within disciplines**
* **Definition of forecasting is much more narrow than most**

> Of these types what is common in ecological forecasting and why?

* Prediction for future state of system
* What-if analysis

### State of ecological forecasting

> Does ecological research tend to focus more on forecasting/prediction or on
  understanding ecological processes?

* Process

> When ecologists do forecast is it research or application focused?

* Research / Proof-of-concept

> What are the two general types of models that can be used for forecasting?

* Process-based
* Data-driven

> What are the different ways in which time and can incorporated into these models?

* Explicitly
* Implicitly (driving variables that change) or not included

> What are the different ways in which model parameters are determined?

* Fixed
* Fitted

> What are the two main types of forecasts being developed and what properties to they have?

* Species distribution models: Data-driven, Implicit, Fitted
* Ecosystem process models: Process-based, Explicit, Fixed (e.g., from lit)

### Uncertainty

> What is the distinction between point estimates and uncertainty?

* Point estimates are the expected value or mean prediction
* Uncertainty is the variability around that mean value, that describes the reasonable range of predictions.

> Do most ecological forecasts include uncertainty estimates?

* No

> Why does estimating uncertainty matter?

* Need to know how much to trust forecasts
* What the realistic range of outcomes could be

### Where do you think we are?

* How good do you think we currently are at forecasting in ecology?
* What does the history of weather forecasting tell you about how that might change?

### Start with dynamics

* The title of this course is Ecological Dynamics and Forecasting
* That's because if we want to be able to forecast the future we need to
  understand how ecological systems change through time
* We will start by spending several weeks learning about
    * Key aspects of ecological dynamics
    * How to find and analyze time-series data
* Then we will move on to using these concepts, data, and tools for thinking
  about and making forecasts
