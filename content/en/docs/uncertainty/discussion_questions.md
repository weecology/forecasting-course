## Adding Sources of Uncertainty

* What are the different sources of uncertainty?
* What is the distinction between uncertainties & sources of variation?
* Can uncertainty in initial conditions be reduced with more data?
* What is the difference between the additive process error and observation
  error?
* What information do covariance matrices provide?

## Thinking probabilistically

* How do the boxes in the the graphical model of logistic growth relate to the
  sources of uncertainty?

## Predictability

* How does disturbance make forecasting difficult?
* Which components of uncertainty (e.g., in eq. 2.1) have the potential to grow
  through time?
* What implications does this have for our ability to forecast
* What aspects of external drivers make systems easy vs. difficult to forecast?
* Are there implications of the need for different experimental designs for
  forecasting vs. hypothesis testing for how we should do science?
* What is the difference between parameter uncertainty and parameter variability?
* What kinds of uncertainty/variability do you think are most important in
  ecological systems?
