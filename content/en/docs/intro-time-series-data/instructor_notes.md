Thinking about ecological data available for forecasting

    Brainstorm: What properties would be ideal data for studying ecological dynamics and making forecasts have?
        Long time-series
        Continuous
        High resolution
        Broad spatial replication

    Brainstorm: what types of data for we have for studying dynamics & making forecasts?
        Talk about each type as it is brought up
        Give or ask for examples of each data type as it is brought up
        Write them down on the board in a horizontal line from "further back in time/easier" to "more recent/more difficult". Spatial only data will come up, write it in a separate (off on one end) section with a "spatial only" label.

    Resurvey -> Idiosyncratic -> Continuous w/Gaps -> Continuous

    Ask what types of data are easier/harder to collect

    Ask what types are more common for going further back in time vs. more recent

    Draw these gradients on board

    How long do you think most ecological studies/time-series are?

    Show: Recent study by Estes et al. 2018

Sources of ecological time-series data

    Brainstorm: Specific sources for ecological time-series data

    Bring over any sources from prior discussion and ask what the datasets in a group have in common

    As dataset for new group is suggested discuss the type of data and start a new column on board

    Community science data
        BBS

    Compilations
        GPDB
        PBDB/Neotoma
        BioTime

    Long-term monitoring
        NEON
        LTERs
        STRI Big Plots
        Fisheries

    "Single Investigator"
        Ecological Archives - Portal, Adler, Goheen, Clarks

What kind of data would you use?

    If you wanted to make a forecast for something you are interested in what do you think the most readily available type of data would be and do you know any specific examples?

Where to find time-series data (if students ask)

    Ecological Archives
    LTER Databank
    DataOne
    Ecological Data Wiki
    Google Data Search
