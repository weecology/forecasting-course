#### **Times and Locations**

Tuesday, Period 5 (11:45-12:35), MCCB 2102

Thursday, Period 5 (11:45-12:35), MCCB 2102

#### **Course Objectives**

The goal of this class is to provide students a basic understanding of
how populations and communities change through time and to provide fundamental 
concepts of how to forecast those changes. By the end of the semester, students will:

1)  Have an appreciation of the dynamics and time scales of change that populations and communities exhibit.

2)  Understand the basic concepts of forecasting that apply across fields 
    and the challenges within ecology

3)  Apply time series concepts to working with ecological time series data

4)  Be able to fit models to data and use those models to make forecasts

#### **General Course Structure and Expectations**

This course is a mixture of class discussion of the primary literature and hands-on
experience involving data and computing. Completing assigned readings,
intellectual engagement with topics, discussion participation, and completion of
assignments are the main ways students will learn in this class. Tuesdays are
typically concept discussion days. Thursdays will be a mix of tools or concept
discussion. 

#### **Course Participation**

The course is designed so that students may participate synchronously or asynchronously in the course. 
Students may shift between synchronous and aynschronous participation as needed. 

##### Paper discussions:
Synchronous participation: During the assigned course time, synchronous discussions of assigned papers 
will occur over zoom. In-class group discussion about the assigned papers paper. 
This discussion is generally centered around the discussion questions that are provided 
in advance but may also expand beyond them. Our goal is to produce a classroom environment where
everyone is comfortable participating in class discussions. We will try to manage discussions so 
that everyone has a chance to contribute and make sure that folks who are less comfortable 
interjecting get a chance to participate. We welcome your help in making sure that everyone 
in the class gets a chance to contribute. 

Asynchronous participation: Students may opt to participate asynchronously by providing written responses to the assigned class discussion questions and submitting those responses to the instructors. Instructor notes will be provided via the course website so that students participating asynchronously have access to information being discussed in class. The Canvas discussion board can also be used to ask questions and generate discussion with the class related to the topic material.

##### R-tutorials

Most weeks we have an R-tutorial session on Thursdays. R-tutorials consist of a video that all students (synchronous and asynchronous) students are required to watch before the thursday class time. Synchronous class time on R-tutorial thursdays is dedicated for students to ask questions, get clarification, or help with their r code. Asynchronous students are encouraged to post their questions to the course discussion board on canvas.

#### **Course Grading**

* 50% of grade will be based on paper paper discussion
* 50% of the grade will be based on completing R tutorials

#### **Attendance Policy**

Two class days can be missed without impacts on your grade without the need
to submit make-up work, though we recommend that students attempt any 
missed class activities on their own time because additional class 
activities or discussions may rely on that knowledge. 

Additional missed days can be made-up by submitting make-up work.
Class activities can be made-up on the student's time by doing
the activity and submitting the code/data. Missed 
discussions can be made up by providing written responses to the discussion questions
on the readings for the day(s) missed. Two to three sentences per question
is an approximate guideline for the length of response to each question, but
feel free to write more or less as appropriate.

#### **Course Materials**

1) All reading materials are made available through the [course website](https://course.naturecast.org/). If you are off campus you may need to use the UF VPN to access some of them.

2) Computers: Computers with R and Rstudio installed are required for the R-tutorial part of the course


### **UF Policies**

#### **University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities**

Students requesting accommodation for disabilities must first register
with the Dean of Students Office (http://www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/). The Dean
of Students Office will provide documentation to the student who must
then provide this documentation to the instructor when requesting
accommodation. You must submit this documentation prior to submitting
assignments or taking the quizzes or exams. Accommodations are not
retroactive, therefore, students should contact the office as soon as
possible in the term for which they are seeking accommodations.

#### **University Policy on Academic Misconduct**

Academic honesty and integrity are fundamental values of the University
community. Students should be sure that they understand the UF Student
Honor Code at http://www.dso.ufl.edu/students.php.

#### **Netiquette and Communication Courtesy**

All members of the class are expected to follow rules of common courtesy
in all email messages, threaded discussions and chats.


#### **Getting Help**

Other resources are available at
